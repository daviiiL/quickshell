# daviiiL's latest quickshell

> Decided to rebase the repo to my new shell look [here](https://github.com/daviiiL/quickshell-new.git)

## TODO

- [ ] Polish services
- [x] Polish lockscreen ui (hiding component and a pixel shifting clock to save my oled monitors)
- [x] Add power management window
- [x] Add a control center window (network, bluetooth, settings, etc) 
- [ ] Add a frontend for openai

## Known Bugs 

- [ ] when changing colorscheme from the control center, the wallpaper picker still holds onto the initial value loaded from Preferences... even after preferences.colorscheme has changed...

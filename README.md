```comment
the colorscheme generation also applys a good color matching the desktop colorscheme to razer peripherals... turn it on via settings/ control center -> preferences... but you need to install openrazer and razer-cli beforehand
```

## TODO

- [ ] Polish services
- [x] Polish lockscreen ui (hiding component and a pixel shifting clock to save my oled monitors)
- [x] Add power management window
- [x] Add a control center window (network, bluetooth, settings, etc) 
- [ ] Add a frontend for openai

## Known Bugs 

- [x] FIXED: when changing colorscheme from the control center, the wallpaper picker still holds onto the initial value loaded from Preferences... even after preferences.colorscheme has changed...
